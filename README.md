We will explore techniques such as infrared (IR) spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy, which provide invaluable insights into molecular structure, functional groups, and chemical composition.

- **Gas Chromatography (GC):** Explore the power of gas chromatography in separating and analyzing volatile compounds. Discover how GC techniques employ a stationary phase and a carrier gas to separate mixtures based on their volatility, enabling precise identification and quantification of various components. Learn about the different detection methods, such as flame ionization detection or mass spectrometry, that are commonly used to enhance compound identification.

- **High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC):** Immerse yourself in the world of high-performance liquid chromatography, a versatile technique for separating and analyzing a wide range of compounds in liquid samples. We will explore the principles behind HPLC, the various modes of separation (such as reverse phase, ion exchange, and size exclusion), and the different detection methods employed. Gain insights into the applications of HPLC in pharmaceutical analysis, environmental monitoring, and other fields.

- **Thermal Analysis:** Embark on a journey into the realm of thermal analysis, where we study the physical and chemical properties of substances as they undergo temperature changes. Discover techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which allow scientists to investigate phase transitions, thermal stability, decomposition processes, and more. Explore how thermal analysis provides valuable information about material characteristics and behavior under different temperature conditions.

- **Rheology:** Dive into the world of rheology, the study of how materials flow and deform under applied forces or stresses. Uncover the fascinating properties of liquids and soft solids through techniques such as viscosity measurements, shear rate analysis, and viscoelasticity studies. Learn how rheological analysis contributes to fields such as polymer science, food technology, and pharmaceutical formulation, enabling the optimization of material properties and performance.

### Agile Planning
This project was developed using agile methodologies, following the principles of delivering small features in incremental sprints. In total, there were x sprints, evenly spaced out over xxx weeks, to ensure a steady pace of development.

All project tasks were organized into epics and categorized based on their priority under the labels of "Must have," "Should have," and "Could have." During the sprint planning, the epics were assigned to specific sprints and story pointed according to their complexity. This approach allowed the team to focus on completing the critical and high-priority stories first, followed by the medium-priority stories, and finally the low-priority or "nice to have" features. By prioritizing in this manner, the core requirements of the project were ensured to be completed, while additional features were added if there was available capacity.

To track the progress and manage the project tasks, a Kanban board was created using GitHub Projects. You can find the Kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/Frangidha/projects/4), where you can access more detailed information about the project cards. Each story, except for the documentation tasks, includes a comprehensive set of acceptance criteria that define the functionality needed to mark the story as complete. This ensures clear guidelines and criteria for evaluating the successful implementation of each feature.
