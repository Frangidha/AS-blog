### Agile Planning
This project was developed using agile methodologies, following the principles of delivering small features in incremental sprints. In total, there were x sprints, evenly spaced out over xxx weeks, to ensure a steady pace of development.

All project tasks were organized into epics and categorized based on their priority under the labels of "Must have," "Should have," and "Could have." During the sprint planning, the epics were assigned to specific sprints and story pointed according to their complexity. This approach allowed the team to focus on completing the critical and high-priority stories first, followed by the medium-priority stories, and finally the low-priority or "nice to have" features. By prioritizing in this manner, the core requirements of the project were ensured to be completed, while additional features were added if there was available capacity.

To track the progress and manage the project tasks, a Kanban board was created using GitHub Projects. You can find the Kanban board [here](https://github.com/users/Frangidha/projects/4), where you can access more detailed information about the project cards. Each story, except for the documentation tasks, includes a comprehensive set of acceptance criteria that define the functionality needed to mark the story as complete. This ensures clear guidelines and criteria for evaluating the successful implementation of each feature.
